## Pipeline

### 1 Processing

Same as in Wong et al 2018. Exact same data_calib$norfolk object as used there, with full-data form.

### 2 Prior distributions

Priors also same as in Wong et al 2018. Using normal and gamma distributions, fit to the distribution of about 30 long tide gauge records from University of Hawaii Sea Level Center, plus a couple other long records.

### 3 Calibration

MCMC...  (add in full description here)
